# Recommender System Final Project

## Project Description
This project involves the development and implementation of a recommender system. The goal is to create a system that can effectively recommend products, services, or content based on user preferences and behaviors.

## Project Overview
The notebook `FinalProject_Notebook.ipynb` contains all the code, analysis, and results for the recommender system project. The project is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and its objectives.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Steps to load and preprocess the data for the recommender system.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand the data better.
4. **Model Development**: Building and training the recommender system model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the recommender system using appropriate metrics.
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of the findings and potential future work.

## Usage
To run the notebook:

1. Download the `FinalProject_Notebook.ipynb` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the notebook file.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
